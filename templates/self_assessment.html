        <p>The COVID-19 test detects if the virus is in your nose or throat. Testing will tell you whether you have COVID-19 at the time of your test, even if you are not showing symptoms.</p>

        <p>It is important that you understand what to do while you await your tests results, and what it means if your COVID-19 test is positive or negative.</p>

        <p>You are <strong>legally required</strong> to self-isolate for any of the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>you test positive for COVID-19.</li>
          <li>you have a cough, fever, shortness of breath, runny nose, or sore throat (for adults) or cough, fever, shortness of breath (for children) that is <strong>not related</strong> to a pre-existing illness or health condition and you have not been tested or are awaiting test results.</li>
          <li>you are a close contact of someone known to have COVID-19.</li>
          <li>you have returned from travel outside Canada within the last 14 days.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you are a close contact of a case, or returned from travel outside of Canada in the last 14 days, you must continue to self-isolate for the full 14 days, even if you have a negative test result.</p>

        <p>You <strong>do not</strong> have to self-isolate if any of the following apply, AND you are not a close contact of a case or returned from travel outside of Canada in the last 14 days:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>you have symptoms of illness that are related to a pre-existing illness or health condition.</li>
          <li>you have tested negative for COVID-19.</li>
          <li>you have tested negative for COVID-19 and have a cough, fever, shortness of breath, runny nose, or sore throat that is not related to a pre-existing illness or health condition. We do always suggest you stay home when sick with any illness, until symptoms resolve; however, if your COVID test is negative, this is not legally required.</li>
        </ul>
